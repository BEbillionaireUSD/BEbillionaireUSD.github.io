Besides tutoring high school students, I taught Data Structures and Algorithms at <a href="https://en.neepu.edu.cn/">Northeast Electric Power University</a>.

I served as a Teaching Assistant for two courses at CUHK:
- <a href="https://proj.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/csci3100/">CSCI3100 Software Engineering</a> in 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 terms.
- <a href="https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/academics/ug-course-list/csci2720/">CSCI2720 Building Web Applications</a> in the 2022-2023 term.
