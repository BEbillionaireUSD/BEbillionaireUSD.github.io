üí° <strong><span style="color: #3274D8">My recent research interest lies in enhancing AI, especially LLMs, for reasoning and coding tasks. In particular:</span></strong>
- Code generation, testing, and debugging.
- Fault diagnosis in cloud computing.

üìö <b>Bio</b>: I'm a 3rd year PhD Computer Science candidate at <a href="https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/">The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)</a> advised by Michael R. Lyu. I am fortunate to work with <a href="https://lingming.cs.illinois.edu/">Lingming Zhang</a> at UIUC.

I've published **6** papers (**4 first-authored**) in top conferences <a href="https://dl.acm.org/conference/icse">ICSE</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/conference/ase">ASE</a>, and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/1000178/all-proceedings">ICDE</a> (<a href="http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/?search=Software&by=all&source=CORE2023&sort=arank&page=1">CORE A*</a>) .
